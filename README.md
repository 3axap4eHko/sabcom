High-performance inter-thread communication using `SharedArrayBuffer` with atomic operations. Bidirectional channels with synchronous and asynchronous APIs. Faster than `postMessage` structured clone and transfer.

## What sabcom Does

sabcom is a **ring-buffer protocol** over SharedArrayBuffer. It handles:
- Bidirectional communication on a single SharedArrayBuffer
- Synchronization between endpoints via Atomics
- Segmented transfer for payloads larger than the ring capacity
- Timeout detection and close semantics

sabcom does **NOT**:
- Create worker threads (you create them with `worker_threads` or `new Worker()`)
- Transfer the SharedArrayBuffer between threads (you pass it via `workerData` or `postMessage`)
- Serialize data (you encode to `Uint8Array` before calling write, e.g., with `TextEncoder` or `JSON.stringify`)

## Features

- **Bidirectional** - both endpoints can read and write on a single buffer
- **Async and Sync APIs** - `write`/`read` (non-blocking) and `writeSync`/`readSync` (blocking)
- **Zero-copy reads** - single-segment messages return a view into the SharedArrayBuffer
- **Segmented transfer** - payloads larger than the ring are split automatically
- **Close and reuse** - channels can be closed and buffers reused
- **Configurable timeouts** - per-operation timeout support
- **Type-safe** - full TypeScript support

## Installation

```bash
npm install sabcom
```

## Complete Example

**worker.ts**
```typescript
import { workerData } from 'worker_threads';
import { open } from 'sabcom';

const ch = open(workerData as SharedArrayBuffer);

const data = ch.readSync();
const message = new TextDecoder().decode(data);
console.log('Worker received:', message);

ch.writeSync(new TextEncoder().encode(message.toUpperCase()));
ch.close();
```

**main.ts**
```typescript
import { Worker } from 'worker_threads';
import { createBuffer, open } from 'sabcom';

const buffer = createBuffer(65536);
const worker = new Worker('./worker.js', { workerData: buffer });
const ch = open(buffer);

const text = 'Hello from the main thread!';
await ch.write(new TextEncoder().encode(text));

const reply = await ch.read();
console.log('Reply:', new TextDecoder().decode(reply));

ch.close();
await worker.terminate();
```

## API

### `createBuffer(byteLength: number): SharedArrayBuffer`

Creates and initializes a SharedArrayBuffer for use as a channel. `byteLength` must be a multiple of 4 and at least 4096.

### `open(buffer: SharedArrayBuffer): Channel`

Opens a channel on the buffer. Two endpoints can open the same buffer (one per thread). Returns the same handle if called twice in the same thread.

### `reset(buffer: SharedArrayBuffer): void`

Resets a closed buffer so it can be reopened. Both endpoints must be closed first.

### Channel

```typescript
interface Channel {
  write(data: Uint8Array, options?: Options): Promise<void>;
  read(options?: Options): Promise<Uint8Array>;
  writeSync(data: Uint8Array, options?: Options): void;
  readSync(options?: Options): Uint8Array;
  close(): void;
}
```

- `write` / `writeSync` - send data to the peer endpoint
- `read` / `readSync` - receive data from the peer endpoint
- `close` - close this endpoint and notify the peer

### Options

```typescript
interface Options {
  timeout?: number; // milliseconds, default: 5000
}
```

## Zero-Copy Reads

When a message fits in a single ring segment and does not wrap the ring boundary, `readSync` and `read` return a `Uint8Array` view directly into the SharedArrayBuffer - no allocation or copy. The view is valid until the next method call on the same channel (`read`, `readSync`, `write`, `writeSync`, or `close`). After that, the underlying memory may be overwritten by the peer.

If you need to keep the data beyond the next call, copy it:

```typescript
const view = ch.readSync();
const copy = view.slice(); // safe to hold indefinitely
```

Messages that wrap the ring boundary or span multiple segments return an owned copy automatically.

## Buffer Sizing

- **Minimum**: 4096 bytes
- **Multiple of 4** required
- **Larger buffers** reduce segmentation overhead for large payloads
- **Recommendation**: 4KB-64KB depending on average payload size

The buffer is split into two ring directions (one per endpoint). Each direction contains control metadata, message descriptors, and a data ring. Larger buffers allocate more data ring space.

## Multi-Worker Architecture

Each worker needs its own SharedArrayBuffer. A single buffer supports exactly two endpoints.

```typescript
import { Worker } from 'worker_threads';
import { createBuffer, open } from 'sabcom';

async function spawnWorker(task: string) {
  const buffer = createBuffer(65536);
  const worker = new Worker('./worker.js', { workerData: buffer });
  const ch = open(buffer);

  ch.writeSync(new TextEncoder().encode(task));
  const result = await ch.read();

  ch.close();
  await worker.terminate();
  return new TextDecoder().decode(result);
}

const results = await Promise.all([
  spawnWorker('task-a'),
  spawnWorker('task-b'),
  spawnWorker('task-c'),
]);
```

## FAQ

### How do I send JSON or objects?

sabcom transfers raw bytes. Serialize before sending:

```typescript
const obj = { hello: 'world', count: 42 };
ch.writeSync(new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(obj)));

const data = ch.readSync();
const parsed = JSON.parse(new TextDecoder().decode(data));
```

### Does sabcom work in browsers?

Yes, with Web Workers. `SharedArrayBuffer` requires cross-origin isolation headers:

```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

### Can I reuse the buffer after closing?

Yes. After both endpoints close, call `reset(buffer)` and reopen:

```typescript
ch.close();
// ... peer also closes ...
reset(buffer);
const ch2 = open(buffer);
```

Or pass the buffer to new workers - `open` auto-resets buffers where both endpoints have closed.

### How do I handle errors?

```typescript
try {
  ch.writeSync(data, { timeout: 5000 });
} catch (err) {
  if (err.message.includes('timeout')) {
    console.error('Peer did not respond in time');
  } else if (err.message.includes('closed')) {
    console.error('Peer closed the channel');
  }
}
```
